# Start-of-Data-Analysis
This repository contains some experiments I did with Python's NumPy library, as I was learning from the book "Python for Data Analysis" by Wes McKinney. NumPy is a powerful library for numerical computing in Python, and it is widely used in data analysis and scientific computing.

In addition to experimenting with NumPy, I also used Matplotlib to create an image plot, which is a type of visualization that shows an image using pixel values. The code for this project can be found in the new_to_numpy.ipynb file.

# NumPy experiments
In my experiments with NumPy, I explored some of the basic functionality of the library, such as creating arrays, manipulating arrays, and performing mathematical operations on arrays. I learnt that an array with floats and integers are essentially a matrix.
I also learned about some of the more advanced features of NumPy, such as broadcasting, indexing, and slicing. I had some fun with some of the linear algebra capabilities and I made some errors when doing some matrix multiplication because I forgot that the rule for multiply matrices is that the number of columns in the first matrix must be equal to the number of rows in the second matrix.


One of the key benefits of using NumPy is that it allows you to perform fast and efficient numerical computations in Python.
This makes it an essential tool for anyone working with data analysis or scientific computing.

# Matplotlib Image Plot
In addition to my experiments with NumPy, I also used Matplotlib to create an image plot. This type of visualization is useful for showing images using pixel values. I don't fully understand it but I will delve into Matplotlib later.

The code for the image plot can also be found in the new_to_numpy.ipynb file, and it shows how to use NumPy and Matplotlib together to create a simple visualization.
